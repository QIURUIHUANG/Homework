<h3 style="font-size: 20px;color:whitesmoke; height: 316px;text-align: left;" >As one of my favorite Japanese cartoon character, I am really fond of his characteristic，so I would like to introduce his story.
<p>Begita, a major character in the Japanese manga and anime adaptation of the Dragon Ball series. He is the prince of the fighting Saiyans and has a high self-esteem. In the past, Begita worked for Frieza's Legion after the planet was destroyed by Frieza. When he first appeared, he was a villainous character who invaded Earth and was later defeated by Son Goku (Saiyan Kakarot) and others. When he heard that Goku had become a Super Saiyan after the battle of Frieza, he decided to aim to surpass Goku and stayed on Earth to work on his training.</p>
<p>
He and Goku protected the Earth on many occasions. After learning the Super Saiyan transformation in the Artificial Man chapter, he initially stayed on Earth with the intention of surpassing Goku, but later fell in love with the planet after having a family, and decided to die with Buu in order to protect the Earth in the battle with Buu. He was later revived to buy time for Goku to create the Genki Bomb, and after defeating Buu, he still tried to cultivate in order to surpass Goku.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 20px;color:whitesmoke; height: 350px;text-align: left;" >From his first visit to Earth to his battle with Sarubuou, one can feel Begita slowly maturing. From an arrogant boy to a mature man, from a discontented and unhappy man, from an unattached child to a responsible man with a longing for freedom, from a heart that defies defeat but has to admit to certain failures. An aristocrat who has fallen from grace but is not willing to do so. A man who has lived an ordinary life that he could never have imagined before.<p>This is Begita, the prince of the strongest fighting race of Saiyans, proud and brave, who exists only to prove to the world his infinite strength, fighting and training, becoming the strongest man in the world with a will of steel. Despite his troubled past, despite the blood on his hands, he has always walked the line between good and evil, not proud of being good and not ashamed of being evil. Like most human beings, he is not entirely good and not entirely bad. Although he is not a perfect human being like the Monkey King, I still love him - the eternal Saiyan Prince Begita</p>
